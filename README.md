# Backend Interface For My CS360 Artificial Intelligence Class

### There is a frontend interface available to check out [here](https://github.com/brighton1101/CS360-Projects-React-Frontend)
The apps work with one another

### Inspiration:
I wanted to create a backend Python app to serve up various AI projects that I did 
in my class over the course of the semester, and learn more about connecting/integrating existing scripts to a web service. Also, I wanted to gain more experience using Flask and writing basic web apps in Python.

### How It's Done:
- Basically just a module that handles entry at root and does routing
- Then a ProjectInterface class module to interact with the scripts I had done
- Then a module containing all the AI scripts

### Tech Used
- Python 3.7
- Flask w CORS support
